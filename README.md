Final Project - Regime Switching Statistical Hedge Strategy
Strategy Idea and Motivation
The idea of the strategy originates from the various regime switching asset allocation strategies proposed by the finance community. In these strategies, dynamic asset allocation is performed when a switch in regime is detected. For example, Kritzman et al. (2012) proposed a two-regime Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to forecast regimes in market turbulence and constructed a dynamical asset allocation strategy. However, the asset allocation rules (weights on different asset classes) presented are arbitrarily defined as stated in the paper. 
Other regime detection methods are also proposed. For example, Nystrup, P., Hansen, B. W., Madsen, H., & Lindstr√∂m, E. (2016) proposed an approach for dynamic asset allocation based on change points detected in CBOE VIX or daily returns of S&P 500 index using a non-parametric approach.
Greatly motivated by the above ideas, I hope to create a Regime Switching Strategy to achieve the following:
-	During low volatility regime, long S&P 500 E-mini futures 
-	During high volatility regime, hedge long position in S&P 500 futures with VIX futures using the appropriate hedge ratio
-	The central idea is to see if quantitative/algorithmic rules designed using Statistical techniques can be applied to identify 1) the correct hedging timing and 2) the correct hedging ratio to prevent the large drawdowns and outperform a simple long-and-hold strategy
-	Most important, the hedge timing and hedge ratio should not be predefined and are determined by data
